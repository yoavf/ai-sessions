# My Transcripts Page - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Application Overview

The My Transcripts page (`/my-transcripts`) is a protected, user-specific dashboard for managing uploaded AI coding session transcripts. This page is part of the AI Sessions application (ai-sessions.dev), built with Next.js 15, NextAuth.js for authentication, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

### Key Features

- **Authentication-Required Access**: Only authenticated users can access this page
- **Transcript Management**: Display all transcripts owned by the authenticated user
- **Metadata Display**: Show title, creation date, message count, file size, and source
- **Transcript Actions**: View (navigate to transcript), delete individual transcripts
- **CLI Token Management**: Generate, copy, and revoke CLI authentication tokens
- **Account Deletion**: Complete account removal with double confirmation
- **Empty State Handling**: Friendly UI when no transcripts exist
- **Real-time Updates**: Client-side state updates after delete operations
- **Security Features**: CSRF protection on all mutating operations, rate limiting

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React client components ("use client")
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 with GitHub OAuth
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- **API Communication**: Fetch API with CSRF token handling
- **Security**: CSRF tokens, rate limiting (Upstash Redis)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample Transcripts

To effectively test the My Transcripts page, the following test data should be available:

1. **Empty State**: User with 0 transcripts
2. **Single Transcript**: User with 1 transcript
3. **Multiple Transcripts**: User with 3-5 transcripts of varying properties:
   - Different sources (Claude Code, Codex, CLI)
   - Different message counts (1, 10, 100, 1000+)
   - Different file sizes (1 KB, 100 KB, 4 MB)
   - Different titles (short, long, special characters)
   - Different creation dates (today, yesterday, 30 days ago)
4. **Large Dataset**: User with 50-100 transcripts for performance testing
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Transcript with 0 messages
   - Transcript with very long title (100+ chars)
   - Transcript with special characters in title
   - Maximum file size (near 5 MB limit)

### Test Users

1. **Test User A**: Has 3 transcripts
2. **Test User B**: Has 5 transcripts (different from User A)
3. **Test User C**: Has 0 transcripts (new user)
4. **Test User D**: Has 100 transcripts (performance testing)

### Database State

- Clean database for each test suite
- Seed with test users and transcripts
- CLI tokens with various expiration states
- Rate limit counters at various levels

## Environment Requirements

- **Database**: PostgreSQL test database
- **Redis** (optional): Upstash Redis for rate limiting (gracefully degrades if not configured)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `DATABASE_URL`: Test database connection
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: `http://localhost:3000`
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Test secret
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Test OAuth app
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Test OAuth secret
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` (optional)
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (optional)
- **Development Server**: Running on `localhost:3000`
- **Playwright**: Configured with chromium browser

## Automation Recommendations

### High Priority for Automation

1. Authentication flow (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
2. Empty state display (2.1)
3. Single and multiple transcript display (2.2, 2.3)
4. Delete transcript with confirmation (4.1, 4.2)
5. Generate and copy CLI token (5.2, 5.3)
6. Account deletion flow (6.4)
7. CSRF token validation (10.1)
8. Rate limiting (10.4)

### Manual Testing Recommended

1. Screen reader accessibility (9.5)
2. Visual design verification
3. Cross-browser compatibility
4. Real mobile device testing
5. Performance profiling (12.1, 12.2)

### Continuous Integration

- Run authentication tests on every PR
- Run full suite nightly
- Performance benchmarks weekly
- Security tests (CSRF, ownership) on every PR

## Success Criteria

A test scenario passes if:

1. **Functional**: All expected behaviors occur as documented
2. **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and screen readers work
3. **Secure**: CSRF, authentication, and authorization checks pass
4. **Performant**: Page loads < 1s, interactions responsive
5. **Robust**: Error handling graceful, no crashes
6. **Cross-browser**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
7. **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, desktop viewports

## Known Limitations

1. **No Real-time Sync**: Deletes in one tab don't update other tabs (by design)
2. **CLI Token Single-View**: Generated token only shown once (security feature)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Requires Redis for enforcement (gracefully degrades without)
4. **OAuth Testing**: GitHub OAuth requires real credentials or mocking
5. **Timezone Display**: Date formatting uses user's browser locale
