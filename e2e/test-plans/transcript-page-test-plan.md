## Test Execution Notes

### Prerequisites for Running Tests

1. **Database Setup**:
   - PostgreSQL test database configured
   - `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set
   - Prisma migrations applied

2. **Server Running**:
   - Next.js dev server running on `http://localhost:3000`
   - Or use Playwright's webServer configuration

3. **Test Data**:
   - Use `e2e/seed-transcript.spec.ts` to create test transcript
   - Or create transcript via API/database before tests

4. **Authentication**:
   - Use `e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` for authenticated scenarios
   - Owner-specific tests require authenticated session

### Test Organization

- **Section 1-2**: Basic page functionality (can run unauthenticated)
- **Section 3**: Title editing (requires authentication)
- **Section 4-8**: Content rendering (unauthenticated)
- **Section 9**: Share functionality (unauthenticated)
- **Section 10**: Delete functionality (requires authentication)
- **Section 11-12**: Layout and responsive (unauthenticated)
- **Section 13-14**: Content types and dark mode (unauthenticated)
- **Section 15**: Accessibility (unauthenticated, may need assistive tools)
- **Section 16-18**: Performance, errors, security (mixed)
- **Section 19**: OpenGraph meta tags (unauthenticated)

### Recommended Test Execution Order

1. Create test transcript using seed script
2. Run unauthenticated tests (sections 1, 2, 4-8, 9, 11-15, 17, 19)
3. Run authenticated tests (sections 3, 10)
4. Run performance tests separately (section 16)
5. Run security tests with specific payloads (section 18)

### CI/CD Considerations

- Tests should be independent and isolated
- Each test should clean up its data
- Use transaction rollback or database cleanup
- Tests should be idempotent
- Parallel execution requires separate test data
- Screenshot/video capture recommended for failures
